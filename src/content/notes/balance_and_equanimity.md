title: Balance and Equanimity
---

_Written on 11:51, 19th March, 2024_ right before the CMI Entrance Exam.

Live in the present. Observe everything.
Breathe out vehemently when in stress.
Have a balanced temperament and equanimous in outlook.
Treat every question equally.
Be evenminded in success and failure.
Allott 4:30 min to each question in Part-A
If successful? Good. If not, move to the next question.
Be goal-oriented:

```
12 X 2  + 12 X 3 = 60
12 X 2 + 12 X 3 + 8 X 1 = 68
12 X 2 + 14 X 3 = 66
12 X 2 + 14 X 3 + 6 X 1 = 72
14 X 2 + 14 X 3 = 70
```

Calm down before each question. Don't fear or fret. Don't self-introspect. Be like an **_Infantry Officer_** being airdropped in an enemy zone. Like Lieutenant Spiers and Major Smith from Band of Brothers. You've practised. You are not hitting in the dark. You know what questions to expect: few CT, few Russian Math Puzzles, few LA, few Prob, few Counting.

Do Mental Math wherever possible. That's your strength and your thoughts are clear there.
